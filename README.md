This project includes a Node.js script for converting numerical values from different bases to base 10 and computing the constant term of a polynomial using Lagrange Interpolation.

## How to Run

1. **Prepare the JSON File:**

   Create a `testCase.json` file in the project directory with the required structure.

2. **Run the Script:**

    ```bash
    node driverCode.js
    ```

   Replace `testCase.json` with the name of the JSON file containing the testcases.

3. **View the Output:**

   The constant term (f(0)) will be printed to the console.
